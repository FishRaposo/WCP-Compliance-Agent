### Documentation Archive (`_archive/documentation/`)

**Purpose**: Additional documentation files moved to archive

**Contents**:

**Note**: Showcase-related files (PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md, SHOWCASE.md, QUICK-START.md, SHOWCASE-QUICK-START.md) have been moved to the `showcase/` folder for recruiters and hiring managers.

**Reason for Archival**: These files were created for the project but are additional documentation files that have been archived for organizational purposes.

## Archive Guidelines

Files and directories are moved to `_archive/` when they:

- Additional documentation files
- Are deprecated or no longer used
- Are example/scaffold code that's not part of the actual project
- Need to be preserved for reference but aren't actively maintained
