# Custom Compliance & Validation Systems

The WCP Compliance Agent is open source and MIT licensed. You can use it, modify it, and deploy it yourself.

Custom enterprise deployments with tailored rules, integrations, and production support are not open source.

## How to Start

**Primary method:** [Hire me via Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ca94c53d0d0101f3)  
→ Platform protection, escrow, dispute resolution  
→ All contracts processed through Upwork

**For enterprise contracts or existing relationships:** Direct engagement possible after initial consultation

## What Makes This Different

Most compliance automation tools fall into three categories:

❌ **Generic SaaS** - Doesn't fit your edge cases, rigid rule structure  
❌ **Custom builds** - Break when regulations change, no error handling  
❌ **"Working prototypes"** - Never reach production, constant babysitting required

**This system is engineered for:**

✅ Custom rule logic without full rewrites when regulations change  
✅ Autonomous operation with explicit error handling and recovery  
✅ Production deployment from day one - observable, testable, maintainable  
✅ Real validation layers that catch issues before they become compliance failures

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I just use the open source version?**  
Yes. It's MIT licensed. If you can deploy and maintain it yourself, you absolutely should.

**Q: What if I need features not in the open source version?**  
That's what Tier 1 is for. Custom implementations extend the base architecture with your specific requirements.

**Q: Do you work with non-US compliance frameworks?**  
Yes. The architecture is jurisdiction-agnostic. Custom rules can be implemented for any regulatory framework (EU, UK, APAC, etc.).

**Q: What's included in "production hardening"?**  
Error recovery, circuit breakers, observability (logging/monitoring), input validation, state management, deployment documentation, and operational runbooks.

**Q: What technologies do you work with?**  
TypeScript, Python, React, Node.js. Vector databases (Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate). LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, open source models). Standard deployment infrastructure (Vercel, AWS, GCP).

**Q: What's your current availability?**  
I take 2-3 projects per quarter to maintain quality. If I'm at capacity, I'll tell you immediately and can refer you to engineers I trust.

**Q: Do you offer payment plans?**  
Yes, through Upwork's milestone-based payment system. Custom payment structures available for enterprise contracts.

**Q: What if the project scope changes mid-implementation?**  
Scope changes are handled through change requests with updated timelines and pricing. Clear communication before any additional work begins.

## Case Studies

### Federal Payroll Compliance (Open Source)
**Challenge:** Complex WCP validation rules with frequent regulatory updates  
**Solution:** Hybrid architecture combining deterministic parsing with LLM reasoning  
**Result:** 300+ clones by working developers in 72 hours, organic distribution with zero marketing

*More case studies available under NDA upon request*

## Why Work With Me

I don't build systems that work in demos. I build systems that survive production.

**Background:**
- 3 years building production AI systems at scale
- Specialization: The 5% of AI pilots that don't die when deployed
- Based in Brazil (LATAM timezone, Silicon Valley standards)
- All code ships with logging, validation, error handling, and documentation

**What you won't get:**
- Generic LangChain implementations
- "It works on my machine" deliverables  
- Systems that require constant human intervention
- Stitched-together prompts pretending to be architecture

**What you will get:**
- Observable, testable, maintainable codebases
- Explicit state management and error recovery
- Architecture decisions documented and justified
- Systems designed for autonomous operation
