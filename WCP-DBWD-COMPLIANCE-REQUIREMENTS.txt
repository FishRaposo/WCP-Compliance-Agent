================================================================================
6. COMPLIANCE VALIDATION RULES
================================================================================

6.1 WAGE RATE VALIDATION
------------------------
RULE 1: Minimum Wage Compliance
- Actual hourly rate >= Prevailing basic rate
- Formula: IF wage < basic_rate THEN violation

RULE 2: Fringe Benefit Compliance
- Cash fringe OR bona fide benefits >= Required fringe
- Formula: IF (cash_fringe + benefit_value) < fringe_rate THEN violation

RULE 3: Total Compensation
- Total hourly compensation >= Total prevailing rate
- Formula: IF (wage + fringe) < (basic_rate + fringe_rate) THEN violation

6.2 OVERTIME VALIDATION
-----------------------
RULE 4: Overtime Hours Threshold
- Regular hours: Up to 40 hours/week
- Overtime hours: Hours > 40/week
- Formula: IF hours > 40 THEN overtime_required

RULE 5: Overtime Rate Calculation
- Overtime rate = 1.5 × basic hourly rate
- Note: Fringe benefits NOT multiplied
- Formula: overtime_rate = basic_rate × 1.5

RULE 6: Overtime Payment Validation
- For hours > 40: rate >= (basic_rate × 1.5) + fringe_rate
- Formula: IF overtime_wage < (basic_rate × 1.5) THEN violation

EXAMPLE:
Electrician works 45 hours
- Basic rate: $51.69
- Fringe rate: $34.63
- Regular pay (40 hrs): 40 × ($51.69 + $34.63) = $3,452.80
- Overtime pay (5 hrs): 5 × ($51.69 × 1.5 + $34.63) = $560.42
- Total required: $4,013.22

6.3 CLASSIFICATION VALIDATION
-----------------------------
RULE 7: Valid Classification
- Worker classification must exist in wage determination
- Formula: IF classification NOT IN wage_determination THEN needs_review

RULE 8: Classification Accuracy
- Work performed must match classification
- Electrician cannot be paid as Laborer for electrical work
- Helper classifications have specific requirements

RULE 9: Split Classifications
- Workers performing multiple trades in same day

- Pay appropriate rate for each classification

6.4 APPRENTICE VALIDATION
-------------------------
RULE 10: Registered Apprentice Program
- Apprentice must be in DOL/state-registered program
- Must have written apprenticeship agreement
- Formula: IF apprentice AND NOT registered THEN violation

RULE 11: Apprentice Wage Rates
- Pay according to registered program schedule
- Percentage of journeyman rate based on progress
- Example: 1st year = 50%, 2nd year = 65%, etc.

RULE 12: Apprentice Ratios
- Cannot exceed ratio in approved program
- Typically 1 apprentice per 3-5 journeymen
- Formula: IF apprentice_count > (journeyman_count × ratio) THEN violation

6.5 DEDUCTION VALIDATION
------------------------
RULE 13: Permissible Deductions
Allowed:

12.3 PIECE WORK
---------------
Scenario: Payment based on units completed
Rule: Convert to hourly equivalent, must meet prevailing
Example:
- 100 units @ $5 each = $500
- 40 hours worked = $12.50/hr effective
- If prevailing = $26.45, violation exists
